                        Elders at ATG Chapel Machakos provide spiritual leadership, oversee welfare programs, participate in decision-making, and support the pastoral team. Their efforts foster unity within the congregation and ensure the spiritual health of the church.
                        The Church Committee plays a crucial role in managing the logistical and administrative aspects of the church. They organize events, worship services, Bible studies, and community outreach programs. Through their dedication, the committee ensures that the church operates smoothly and serves the congregation effectively.
                        Together, the Elders and the Committee form a cohesive unit that upholds the mission and vision of ATG Chapel Machakos
