 At ATG Chapel Machakos, Pastors and Deacons work collaboratively to strengthen the spiritual and communal
  life of the church. Pastors provide spiritual leadership, counseling, and support, while also overseeing
   the mentee ministry, guiding worship, and teaching. They play a pivotal role in the spiritual growth of 
   the congregation and its engagement with the broader community.
Deacons complement this leadership by handling practical tasks such as serving communion,
 providing pastoral care, organizing church events, and supporting charitable activities. Together,
  the Pastors and Deacons create a harmonious and effective leadership team, ensuring the spiritual and
   operational well-being of ATG Chapel Machakos.
