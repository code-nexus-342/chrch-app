                        Church Programs One of the ongoing initiatives at ATG Chapel Machakos 
                        is the construction of a new church building. This project, funded through weekly
                         contributions during Sunday services, aims to create a larger and more accommodating space for worship.
                          Members of the congregation are encouraged to support this noble cause through prayers, donations, and
                           active participation. The new church building represents a
                         collective vision of growth and unity for ATG Chapel Machakos.
